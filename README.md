# Bradly's YouTube Downloader
Google Chrome Extension for Downloading YouTube Videos

## Introduction

Download YouTube videos without pain. Inserts a dropdown button with links to directly download the current video from YouTube in multiple formats. Easily integrates with the UI and does not interfere or rely on third party resources.  

As of December 20th, 2015, Google removed the extension from their web store. It had around 50,000 installs and over 250 reviews with a 4.38/5.0 star rating. You can still obtain the extension here and I will update it over time. I will start pushing out major releases for public consumption. It may take longer for releases to be made available here and you may find the latest version here does not work sometimes. (As of this readme update, I am inbetween cycles and github's Windows client is terrible at managing branches; thus, I cannot currently sync until my branch changes are committed. Very annoying, GitHub. Work on your bad code.)

## Usage

Go to a video on YouTube, click the Download button, and click on a format that you desire. The download will begin and come directly from YouTube's servers.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this extension was to allow for users to easily and safely download YouTube videos. There were already extensions and websites available that allowed for the downloading of YouTube videos but they came at a great cost in convenience or safety. None of them did it without taking your information, inserting advertisements into the page, or trying to insert malware into your computer. This is where Bradly's YouTube Downloader comes in and saves the day!

## Installation

Enable Developer Mode in Google Chrome and install the extension, [as described here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).

A detailed video is [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRBKYiumhQI) that details error reporting, installation, updating, and a bit of troubleshooting.
